# This program allows you to see how many alumni from your university work for a particular company or list of companies

## IMPORTANT: 
- DO NOT USE PERSONAL LINKEDIN ACCOUNT WHEN RUNNING THIS PROGRAM
- Before running program, make sure you have a non-primary LinkedIn account created and have logged into it in your chrome browser
- You will need to use a non-primary account in case the account gets locked out/restricted since LinkedIn doesn't like web scrapers ;)
- Many measures are taken in the code to prevent account getting locked out/restricted, but there is always a chance of the bot being recognized
